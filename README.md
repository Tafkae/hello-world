"Hello World" Tutorial for Code Kentucky (Aug 2024)

Hi! My name's Lisa. I actually have a BS in Computer Science already, but I'm enrolling in boot camp to expand my language proficiencies and hone my self-promotion skills. Currently I work as an AI Trainer, which is *technically* in my field, but ultimately my career goal is to get into a more technical role ~~(with a little more earning power)~~.

I live with a very large cat and a very small cat. And also another human I guess.
